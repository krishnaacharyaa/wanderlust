## ‚ùå You'll never get issue assigned

- I want to work on this issue please assign it to me, I'll enhance UI

- \_Create an AI generated issue \_and ask to assign

## ‚úÖ You'll easily get issue assigned

- Hi, I know the fix for this issue, the code is breaking because of the useEffect we have added there, instead of that we need to use UseLayoutEffect, I can fix it within **ETA**: 1day.
- Hi, I seen a UI enhancement in category section of the website, here goes my sample UX/images <_link>_. And I want to pick this issue

## üí°Prop tip from the Project Admin (Me üòú)

- I am happy to provide you the points you need to reach the leaderboard, I look forward to give more points than needed if required, but the minimum I expect is your genuine interest to solve the issue and contribute.
- Want GSSoC points? Not the right place for you. Want to learn things and master git place for you, and forget about points you'll get more than expected
- I'm happy to help anyone who is really concerned in learning, _**but please don't spam 100s of project with your random message**_, Stick to 2-3 projects of your like and work on it.
- Didn't get any issue to work on? Just join the project's discord in readme. I'll help you find one :)
- Happy learning. Feel free to connect if you are concerned with learning and growing üòä

## For those who have time read below

### Issue Assignment Process

- **Preparation**: Contributors must thoroughly investigate issues before expressing interest.
- **ETA**: Provide an estimated time of completion for the issue.
- **Approach**: Describe the planned method or solution to resolve the issue.

### Communication

- **Expression of Interest**: Contributors should demonstrate their understanding and readiness to tackle the issue, rather than simply requesting assignment.

### Restrictions

- **AI-Based Issue Creation**: The use of AI to generate issues is strictly discouraged.
- **Handling Existing Issues**: Contributors are encouraged to focus on resolving existing issues rather than creating new, unnecessary ones.
